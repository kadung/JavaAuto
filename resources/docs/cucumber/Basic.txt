========================================================================================================================
	Overview:
========================================================================================================================
Test types:
    - Test Driven Development (TDD) — Tests are written before code and passing the tests is the critical driver of
    development.

    - Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) — Team members with different perspectives (customer, business analyst,
    tester, developer) collaborate and write acceptance tests in advance of implementing the corresponding functionality.

    - Behavior Driven Development (BDD) — Tests are written in a non-technical language that everyone can understand (ex:
    a domain-specific language like Gherkin). BDD combines the principles of TDD and ATDD and forms an approach for
    building a shared understanding on what kind of software to build by discussing examples.

BDD cycles consists:
    - Identify business feature.
    - Identify scenarios under the selected feature.
    - Define steps for each scenario.
    - Run feature and fail.
    - Write code to make steps pass.
    - Refactor code, Create reusable automation library.
    - Run feature and pass.
    - Generate test reports.

Advantages of BDD:
    - The biggest advantage of behavioral tests might be that they describe a set of functions that a user expects from
    a system in a very concrete and direct manner. The sum of these behaviors essentially document a contract with the
    user/client. If any of the tests fail, this contract is not upheld.

BDD test steps:
    1. Writing Features
        - Features, scenarios, and steps together form Behavior tests. These tests are normally written in a business
        readable, domain specific language (DSL). Gherkin is a popular language which is used for writing narrative user
        stories.
        - This step is the most important stage of BDD. Three amigos (business person, developer, tester) get together
        and identify the expected behavior of our product by discussing examples.
        - Example:
            Feature: feature name
              As a [role]
              I want [feature]
              So that [benefit/business reason]

             Scenario: title
              Given context
              When event
              Then outcome
              And/But more of the same ...

             Scenario Outline: title
              Given .... <placeholder 1> .....
              When .... <placeholder 2> ...
              Then ... <placeholder 3> ...

              Examples:
                | placeholder 1 | placeholder 2 | placeholder 3 |
                |  value        |   value       |  value        |
                |  value        |   value       |  value        |

    2. Creating Tests
        - After business persons write the feature file, QA people start implementing the test suites. For writing BDD
        tests, BDD Test Frameworks are used.
        - Popular BDD Frameworks:
              . Java: Cucumber, JBehave
              . Ruby:Cucumber
              . PHP: Behat
              . JavaScript: cucumber.js, jasmine

    3. Complete Test Cycle


========================================================================================================================
	Cucumber: BDD framework
========================================================================================================================
- Cucumber is first and foremost a collaboration tool that aims to bring a common understanding to software teams — across
roles. BDD tools like Cucumber are made to drive the entire life cycle of software implementation in more collaborative
manner.
- Cucumber features should drive the implementation, not reflect it. Cucumber is not a tool for testing software. It is
a tool for testing people’s understanding of how software (yet to be written) should behave.

1. Writing Features
    - Use Feature Mapping approach to effectively analyse and elaborate the product behavior:
        a. Define a feature or story, or pick one from the backlog
        b. Understand what actors are involved in the story
        c. Break the feature into tasks to identify the main flows
        d. Identify examples that illustrate a principle or variant flow (Ask questions like: “But what if…”; “what else
        could lead to this outcome”; “what other outcomes might happen”; and use the answers to create new examples)
        e. Create Executable Specifications: automate the main high-level flows with pending steps.
    - Example:
        a. Writing a high level features and scenarios in a business readable grammar
        b. In this case, there is only one actor  -  the employee:
            Feature 1: Login Profile
              As an employee of the company
              I want to login my employee profile using my credentials
              In order to collaborate with my colleagues
            Feature 2: Update Profile
              As an employee of the company
              I want to be able to update my name, projects, email, and phone numbers on my profile
              In order to share my contact information with my colleagues
        c. Break feature into tasks and scenarios:
            Feature 1: Login Profile
                Scenario: Successful login
                Scenario: Failed login using wrong credentials
            Feature 2: Update Profile
                Scenario: Update name
                Scenario: Add new projects
        d. To execute scenarios, we need to establish the steps and rules involved in each scenario:
            Feature 1:
                Background: User navigates to Company home page
                Steps: 1) Go to company home page
                       2) See login option (this is a consequence of above step)

                Scenario: Successful login
                Steps: 1) Enter correct credentials
                       2) Login to account
                       3) See welcome message (this is a consequence of above step)
                Scenario: Failed login using wrong credentials
                Steps: 1) Enter incorrect credentials
                       2) Login to account
                       3) See error message (this is a consequence of above step)
        e. Convert above story-like scenarios to executable steps in Given/When/Then format of Gherkin language:
            Feature 1:
                Background: User navigates to Company home page
                  Given I am on the "Company home" page on URL "www.mycomany.com"
                  Then I should see "Log In as Employee" message

                Scenario: Successful login
                  When I fill in "Username" with "Test"
                  And I fill in "Password" with "123"
                  And I click on the "Log In" button
                  Then I am on the "My profile" page on URL "www.mycompany.com/myprofile"
                  And I should see "Welcome to your profile" message
                  And I should see the "Log out" button


2. Create test script with Cucumber java and TestNG
